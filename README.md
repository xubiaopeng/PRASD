The work flow includes three parts: 
1. Protein structure reconstruction from pure geometric restraints: Using the matlab source code (or the standalone application if you do not have Matlab software, whose instruction is in file README_PRASD.md) 
2. Energy Minimization (EM):  See the README.md file in the folder "EM-procedure"
3. Water refinement: See the README.md file in the folder "water_refine"

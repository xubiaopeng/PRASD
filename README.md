The work flow includes three parts: 
1. protein structure reconstruction from geometric restraints: Using the matlab source code (or the standalone application if you do not have Matlab software installed, whose instruction is in file README_PRASD) 
2. Energy Minimization (EM):  See the README file in folder EM_
3. water refinement.
